    <h3>Warcraft Style</h3>
    <p><b>Cooking</b> is a secondary profession which allows players to combine
    various ingredients such as fish or meat into delicious food and drink
    items which can be consumed to restore health and mana, as well as to grant
    combat buffs. This skill is often paired with <em>Fishing</em>, since leveling the latter often provides the materials needed for Cooking.</p>
    <p>Cooking requires a Cooking Fire. Many of these are stationary objects
    throughout the world, but you can also create a fire using the <em>Cooking
      Fire</em> ability you get with Cooking. If you want to have a more fun fire, you
    can also use toys such as the <em>Crystalline Campfire</em> or <em>Cozy
      Bonfire</em>, or summon pets such as <em>Lil' Ragnaros</em> or
    <em>Pierre</em>.</p>
